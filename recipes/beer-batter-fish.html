  <h1>Beer Batter Fish Made Great</h1>
  <img src="../img/beer-batter-fish.jpeg" alt="Beer batter fish made great">
  <p>This beer-battered fish is a great recipe and very easy to make. We often fish all day with friends and then cook the fish afterward out on deck, enjoying the fresh catch straight from the water. The crispy, golden-brown coating is light and airy, thanks to the beer, while a blend of garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper adds just the right amount of seasoning. Served hot with a squeeze of lemon and your favorite dipping sauce, this fish is a delicious reward after a long day on the water.</p>
